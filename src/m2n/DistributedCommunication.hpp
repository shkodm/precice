/**
 * @brief Interface for all distributed solver to solver communication classes.
 *
 *
 * By default, communication is done within the local communication space. In
 * order to connect to a different communication space, i.e. coupling participant,
 * the methods acceptConnection() and requestConnection() have to called by the
 * two participants which intend to establish a connection. All following
 * communication and process ranking refers to the remote communication space
 * afterwards.
 *
 * This interface organizes the communication between 2 distributed participants.
 * The core communication (e.g. Sockets or MPI) is still handled in com/Communication.hpp .
 * The information on how the mesh is distributed can be accessed through the member variable
 * _mesh.
 *
 * The class offers methods to communicate between all processors. This can either
 * mean that data is communicated in a distributed way, in case of arrays, or that single values
 * are broadcasted.
