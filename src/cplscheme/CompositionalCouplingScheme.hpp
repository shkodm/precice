/**
 * @brief Acts as one coupling scheme, but consists of several composed ones.
 *
 * The sequence of how the schemes are added by addCouplingScheme() determines
 * their execution sequence. The schemes are executed from first added to last
 * added, following the rule that implicit schemes need to be converged before
 * executing the next explicit scheme/s.
 * An example with implicit schemes I1, ..., I5 and explicit
 * schemes E1, ..., E4 is given here. The schemes are added in the sequence
 *
 *   I1, I2, E1, E2, I3, E3, I4, I5, E4
 *
 * The execution is as follows:
 *
 *   1. I1 and I2 iterate until convergence
 *   2. E1 and E2 are computed
 *   3. I3 iterates until convergence
 *   4. E3 is computed
 *   5. I4 and I5 iterate until convergence
 *   6. E4 is computed
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 are computed directly when 1 is converged, i.e., no additional
 * solver iteration/computation is necessary. Step 3, however, will require
 * additional solver computations for every additional iteration. Similarly,
 * 4 and 5 are computed directly when 3 is converged and 6 is computed directly
 * when 5 is converged.
 *
 * The grouping into such "active" sets is repeatedly done, in order to know
 * which coupling schemes should be executed. The implicit coupling scheme
 * actions constants::actionWrite/ReadIterationCheckpoint() is used to find out
 * about whether a coupling scheme does perform iterations.
 *
 * When, in an active set of implicit coupling schemes, a scheme is converged but
 * others not, the converged scheme is put on hold until all schemes in the
 * active set are converged. This assumes that the converged state of a coupling
 * scheme is not deteriorated by the further iteration of the
 * remaining non-converged schemes.
 *
 * The execution of each scheme does not only depend on this sequence, but also
 * on how the participants are configured to be first and second in the schemes.
 * If not configured properly, a deadlock might be created.
